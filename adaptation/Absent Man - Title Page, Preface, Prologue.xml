            <hi rend="all-caps">THIS</hi> farce was written some years
            ago, since which time it has lain by
            the author, without being offered to the
            stage; nor should he have ventured it there
            at all, but to serve <name type="person">Mr. Holland</name> at his be-
            nefit; upon which occasion, he thought the
            public, through favor to so deserving a per-
            former, would be willing to be pleased with 
            any thing.
        </p>
        <p n="7" rend="first-indent">
            The event has greatly exceeded his hopes;
            the farce was not only received with general
            approbation the first night, but that sort of
            approbation which a writer may depend upon 
            with greatest safety.

        <p n="9" rend="first-indent">
            And on the second night,it met with marks
            of favour still more manifest; this engaged
            the author to look over it with greater care
            than he had before done, and having heighten-
            ed some places where he thought it most de-
            ficient, he now submits it to the public, in a
            form, in which, he hopes it will not utterly
            displease, though it is needless to say that
            things of this kind have their principal merit
            in representation.

            Regnard one of the most famous French
            comic poets, ranked by his countrymen next
            to <name type="person">Moliere</name>, has written a play of five acts
            upon this subject, called, <title type="play">le <hi rend="all-caps">DISTRAIT</hi></title> how
            ever, exclusive of their great disparity in merit;
            no two pieces can be less alike than that, and
            <title type="play">the <hi rend="all-caps">ABSENT MAN</hi></title>; atleast, where the ma-
            terials have been drawn from the same source.
            <title type="play">The <hi rend="all-caps">DISTRAIT</hi></title> of Regnard is exactly the
            <!--must figure this line out -->Menalcas of La Bruyere's characters, a few 
            things only left out, which, though possessed
            of a pleasant extravagance in recital, would be
            too absurd for actual representation; the hint
            of <name type="play">the <hi rend="all-caps">ABSENT MAN</hi></name>, and no more, is taken<!--doublecheck titles/names -->
            from the same character of Menalcas, tran-
            slated in one of the numbers of the Spectator;
            with the assistance of which, if the present
            writer has been able to produce a laughable
            farce, it is all he aimed at, and he pretends to
            no more praise than such a trifling composition
            may deserve.
