            men of old, when they had escaped
            any danger at sea, to dedicate their
            little skiffs to whatever Tutelary Being
            they attributed its preservation: there

            with great pleasure I take this method

            Indeed, when I consider your punci-
            tuality in attending the rehearsals of
            this little piece, though out of the
            common business of the theatre; and
            the care you took, not only to be perfect
            yourself, but that it should be, in every
            respect, produced as complete as possi-
            ble; I cannot help congratulating all
            our present writers on the stage, on
            the acquisition of a performer of such
            uncommon merit; and so great
            a favorite with the public; who,
            they may be assured, will consider their
            advantage and reputation, as well as his
            own; and do their pieces, at least, all
            the justice they are capable of receiv-
            ing.

            Had I an inclination to indulge my-

            now tell you, with truth, that few
            men have filled so many characters
            with the same propriety that you have;
            but I leave this to some news-

            to say, your acquaintance in private life,

            <hi rend="all-caps">THIS</hi> farce was written some years
            ago, since which time it has lain by
            the author, without being offered to the
            stage; nor should he have ventured it there
            at all, but to serve <name type="person">Mr. Holland</name> at his be-
            nefit; upon which occasion, he thought the
            public, through favor to so deserving a per-
            former, would be willing to be pleased with 
            any thing.
        </p>
        <p n="7" rend="first-indent">
            The event has greatly exceeded his hopes;
            the farce was not only received with general
            approbation the first night, but that sort of
            approbation which a writer may depend upon 
            with greatest safety.

            And on the second night,it met with marks
            of favour still more manifest. <note>The Absent Man play was performed earlier in 1768 and seems to have garnered mixed results from critics. 
                Volume 25 of The Critical Review, Or, Annals of Literature (1768) by W. Simpkin and R. Marshall write: 
                "To render the character of an Absent Man entertaining on the stage, much more is required, and might have been expected, from a writer than a transcript from a writer than a transcript from Bruyere: 
                his Menalcas is a caricature from Theophrastus whose original draught itself is much less pleasing, natural, and dramatic, than the Parson Adams of our inimitable Fielding."  
                Coversely, the 1768 The Monthly Review, or Literary Journal by Several Hands writes rather curtly: "A laughable entertainment enough." </note>This engaged
            the author to look over it with greater care
            than he had before done, and having heighten-
            ed some places where he thought it most de-
            ficient, he now submits it to the public, in a
            form, in which, he hopes it will not utterly
            displease, though it is needless to say that
            things of this kind have their principal merit
            in representation.

            Regnard one of the most famous French
            comic poets, ranked by his countrymen next
            to <name type="person">Moliere</name>, has written a play of five acts
            upon this subject, called, <title type="play">le <hi rend="all-caps">DISTRAIT</hi></title> how
            ever, exclusive of their great disparity in merit;
            no two pieces can be less alike than that, and
            <title type="play">the <hi rend="all-caps">ABSENT MAN</hi></title>; atleast, where the ma-
            terials have been drawn from the same source.
            <title type="play">The <hi rend="all-caps">DISTRAIT</hi></title> of Regnard is exactly the
            <!--must figure this line out -->Menalcas of La Bruyere's characters, a few 
            things only left out, which, though possessed
            of a pleasant extravagance in recital, would be
            too absurd for actual representation; the hint
            of <name type="play">the <hi rend="all-caps">ABSENT MAN</hi></name>, and no more, is taken<!--doublecheck titles/names -->
            from the same character of Menalcas, tran-
            slated in one of the numbers of the Spectator;
            with the assistance of which, if the present
            writer has been able to produce a laughable
            farce, it is all he aimed at, and he pretends to
            no more praise than such a trifling composition
            may deserve.

            <head>The Play</head>
            <p>The 1768 play/adaptation of The Absent Man: a Farce was printed in quarto format (and 
                presumably published) by William Griffin, and though the text’s authorship is left anonymous, 
                the play is attributed to Isaac Bickerstaff, a pseudonym used by Jonathan Swift. The premise 
                of the play is based on the character Menalcas that appears in Jean de La Bruyère’s Les Caractères 
                de Théophraste traduits du grec avec Les Caractères ou les moeurs de ce siècle (English title: 
                Characters, or the Manners of the Age: With the Moral Characters of Theophrastus). Menalcas appears 
                in the seventh paragraph in the chapter titled “XI. Of Mankind.” The quarto in this digital edition 
                contains a stamped title page, a dedication to the king (from William Griffin?), a preface, a 
                prologue by the author of the play, a dramatis personae, and the two act play itself (and all of 
                its dialogue, stage directions, and scene and act markers and changes).
                They play was performed by His Majesty’s Servants at the Theater Royal in Drury-Lane.</p>

            <head>The Project</head>
            <p>The Absent Man project was created as a collaborative effort between Andreas Bassett 
                and Sarah Moore, under the direction of Dr. Geoff Turnovsky and the ENGL501 Textual 
                Studies and Digital Editing course during the Autumn 2019 quarter at the University of 
                Washington. Our project is a online critical edition of The Absent Man: A Farce, a 1768 
                theatrical adaptation of Jean de la Bruyère’s Les Charactères. Our project is designed 
                to meet the needs of general reader, students, and researchers interested in engaging in 
                an obscure work influenced by La Bruyère’s Les Charactères.
                This edition is informed by the idea of close reading and textual enfolding, that is, that 
                meaning is created as a text reveals or obscures information. To that end, this digital 
                project is built around the concept of curating selections of the text to interact with. 
                Users can, for example, choose to only see dialogue spoken by specific characters, or focus 
                on specific scenes. Users can also hide or reveal textual and critical notes. In this way, 
                The Absent Man mimics the separate-but- related character sketches of Les Charactères.</p>

            <p><persName ref="AB">Andreas Bassett</persName>is a second-year doctoral student at the University 
                of Washington, Seattle where he studies early modern drama and medieval literature. 
                His research interests include the Shakespeare apocrypha, print culture, bibliography, 
                stylometry, the Matter of Britain, and some of the lesser-known dramatists of the 
                Elizabethan era. At the moment Andreas is working on his master’s essay which traces, 
                historicizes, and analyzes three apocryphal plays by the obscure “W. S.,” Locrine (1595), 
                Thomas Lord Cromwell (1602), and The Puritan (1607), a tragedy, history, and comedy, 
                respectively, as an independent and cohesive trilogy. He is also currently working on 
                developing an authoritative digital edition of Nostradamus’ Les Prophecies.</p>

                the University of Washington, where she studies late medieval romance and early modern 
                drama. She has an interest in the environmental humanities and the materiality of textual 
                manuscripts, and as such several of her past projects have focused on the connections 
                between animal, women, and text. Currently, Sarah is completing a certificate in textual 
                studies, in which she is applying her knowledge of the material text to the creation of 
                digital editions. She received her master’s degree from the University of Alabama in Huntsville, 
                with thesis work that examined the animal and female bodies in The Avowyng of Arthur and Marie de 
                France’s Yonec. Sarah continuously seeks to improve her pedagogy, and has repeatedly used her 
                research as a means of sparking discussion in the classroom, where she aims to help students find 
                their critical voices.</p>
